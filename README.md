# WhisperWell
Project submission for Axxess Hackathon

## Inspiration
Our journey began with in-depth conversations with Axxess stakeholders, which allowed us to identify critical pain points in the home healthcare industry. We realized that the key to improving patient care was to save time for healthcare professionals, and thus, we focused on developing an efficient and effective solution.

## What it does
WhisperWell revolutionizes the OASIS form-filling process by automating it, substantially reducing the time and effort required from healthcare professionals. This streamlined documentation process minimizes errors, increases accuracy, and allows caregivers to allocate more time to providing personalized care for their patients.

## How we built it
To create WhisperWell, we combined cutting-edge speech-to-text technology with the OpenAI API for natural language processing. This integration enabled us to convert spoken words into text and intelligently extract relevant data points for populating the OASIS form, ensuring seamless automation of the form-filling process.

## Challenges we ran into
One of our most significant challenges was prompt engineering, which turned out to be far more complex than initially anticipated. Ensuring that our model could accurately understand and respond to a wide range of user inputs required extensive testing, fine-tuning, and creative problem-solving.

Choosing the ideal name also proved challenging. While "WisperWehl" was a strong contender, after much deliberation, the team reached a consensus on "WhisperWell."

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are incredibly proud of our comprehensive business research and stakeholder analysis, which allowed us to identify a practical, real-world solution for Axxess. Our ability to address the needs of healthcare professionals and develop an efficient tool has been a rewarding experience.

## What we learned
Throughout the development process, we gained valuable insights into the importance of considering multiple stakeholders' perspectives in the healthcare industry. By taking a holistic approach and understanding the bigger picture, we were able to identify core issues and develop an innovative solution that addresses the needs of various parties involved. This experience reinforced the significance of empathy, active listening, and effective communication when creating impactful healthcare solutions.

## What's next for WhisperWell
Our vision for WhisperWell's future includes creating custom machine-learning models and large language models to fully automate the remaining aspects of the OASIS document. By further enhancing efficiency and accuracy, we aim to empower healthcare professionals to focus on what truly matters - providing high-quality care to their patients.
